Todo:
- must have: use 2 8bit colors for controlling both a warm and cold LED
- must have: send output as http request
- nice to have: For the rgb leds, add the tweakers library functionality
- nice to have: change order by manually clicking the canvas

Notes:
- By default, the noLoop() is set, so every time the user interacts, everything is recalculated. That is
  much more performant as to do this 60 fps.
- You can drag 'n drop images to the canvas.
